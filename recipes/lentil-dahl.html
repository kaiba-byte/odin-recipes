        <p>Lentil Dahl is an indian lentil dish. I don't know anything 
            much about it. I had a friend from Dehli once who told 
            me he would have it every day for lunch back home. He woudln't eat 
            mine. But I think that's because of the time i cooked the worst
        mushroom dish ever for him. 
        </p>
        <p> anyway what I can say about lentil dahl is that it's absolutely
            delicious and healthy too!

        <ol>
            <li>Cook the lentils by boiling or pressure cooking until lentils are soft. (Pressure cooking is faster.)</li>
